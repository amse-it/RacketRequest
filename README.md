# RacketRequest

## Note
### Migrations:
Please run `makemigrations` so others won't need to.
### Coding Standards
There are others who indent with tabs and others with spaces.
I suggest we agree to use
[(4) spaces to indent lines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces "PEP 8 - Tabs or Spaces?").


## Requirements
Use django 1.8 and python 2
